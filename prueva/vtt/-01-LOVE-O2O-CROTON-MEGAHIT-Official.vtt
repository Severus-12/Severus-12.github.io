00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.920
EPISODE 1

3
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.219
Luwei Wei Wei, remember to be careful.

4
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.159
Zhen Shui, I will distract him,

5
00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.599
as usual, attack him from the back -Okay

6
00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.399
Hurry, follow.

7
00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.799
Wow, the Almighty Magic Necklace?

8
00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.039
Ni Ni, your equipment.

9
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960
Wow.

10
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.200
I am so lucky today

11
00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.199
Th Almighty Magic Necklace?

12
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.579
Luwei Wei Wei

13
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.780
Interested in a duel?

14
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.040
Sure.

15
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.800
There should be a gain from a duel.

16
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.660
Let's use the necklace as the prize.

17
00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:28.360
What do you think?

18
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.519
So you have your eye on the necklace,

19
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.140
however, it's not mine.

20
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.280
Then I'll battle you!

21
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.879
You are one of the top ten players on this sever,

22
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.600
I don't stand a chance against you.

23
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.779
You can have Luwei Wei Wei fight in you place.

24
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.640
If I lose,

25
00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:47.399
I will give you the Almighty Magic ring.

26
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.400
Dare to battle?

27
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.060
Wei Wei?

28
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.360
Okay.

29
00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.120
It's settled, see you at 5 at the tavern on the outskirts of Jinling City.

30
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.540
Zhen Shui...

31
00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:07.860
You asked to see me, is something wrong?

32
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.020
Is the enemy lurking around?

33
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.760
Wei Wei...

34
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.960
We have been married for half a year,

35
00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.240
and you're still calling me Zhen Shui?

36
00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.319
Isn't that a...little too weird?

37
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.759
Um...

38
00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.600
If I call you Wu Xiang,

39
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.879
that's even more weird.

40
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.100
-Honey,

41
00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.459
the daily quest is 12 three-eye monkeys,

42
00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:30.099
can you kill them for me?

43
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.840
-Honey, you just sit and watch. Let me do it.

44
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.500
-Okay

45
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.200
Wei Wei...

46
00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.699
you're studying in Beijing, right?

47
00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.579
I am in Beijing too. Do you want to meet?

48
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.840
I'll buy you dinner.

49
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.240
I know a very good Japanese restaurant, it's comparable to Michelin Three Stars in Japan.

50
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.920
That's not necessary.

51
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.099
Let's just have fun in the game.

52
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.260
There's a saying now...

53
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.740
that you don't know whether you are playing with a human or a dog

54
00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:11.079
i just want to make sure...

55
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.060
I want to see how you look like

56
00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:15.800
Could you send me your photo?

57
00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.719
Professor Yu's class is great

58
00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.719
-Hello...-Hello...

59
00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.459
Wei Wei, there's nobody outside, hurry!

60
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.979
What happened? Suddenly the power is out.

61
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.420
The circuit seems to be burnt.

62
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.579
I just cooked  noodles and the circuit is out?

63
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.759
The dorm assistant will be mad at me...

64
00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.959
Couldn't you have calculated the amount of current you need before cooking?

65
00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:03.419
Come on, I'm in Computer Science, not Electrical Engineering.

66
00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.639
What do I do? My noodles are still in the pot.

67
00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.659
What do you mean what do you do?

68
00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.199
Give me half of your noodles.

69
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.720
Done

70
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.600
You're awesome

71
00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:30.120
No wonder us CS (Computer Science)  girls can't find our Mr. Right, we do everything ourselves. What do we need guys for?

72
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.360
First of all, I did the electrical work

73
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.580
but that has nothing to do with you not being able to find a boyfriend.

74
00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:40.159
Secondly, my online friend just asked me for a photo and I suddenly disappeared.

75
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.400
He must think that I don't dare to share my photo.

76
00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:45.199
So tell me, how are you gonna compensate me for the damage to my reputation?

77
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.959
Ah, you mean your partner in the game, Zhen Shui Wu Xiang?

78
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.920
Wow Wei Wei!

79
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.620
Hold on. How did you know about that?

80
00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:58.079
Where you peeping at my game while I was playing?

81
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.160
Don't pay attention to the details.

82
00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:05.939
So are you going to give him your photo?

83
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.160
Of course not.

84
00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:10.379
We got married to do quests.

85
00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:12.899
It's weird to share photos.

86
00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:14.959
But it is not nice to go offline like that.

87
00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.500
At least I should have given an excuse,

88
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.139
for example, my computer has crashed

89
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.860
and I lost all my photos

90
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.379
no way

91
00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:32.959
Your computer crashed and you lost all your photos?

92
00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.299
You are such a jinx...

93
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.459
How could this happen?

94
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.220
Wei Wei...

95
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.860
I forgot to tell you...

96
00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:44.100
when I borrowed your laptop yesterday...

97
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.259
I was careless ...

98
00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.259
and I dropped it.

99
00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:51.019
Where are you running off to?! Stop running Come back here!

100
00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.000
It's my fault, my fault...

101
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.139
What exactly happened?

102
00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:55.480
Tell me everything!

103
00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:57.120
-Aiya.. -Let's go...

104
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.780
My noodles! I haven't finished my noodles!

105
00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:03.259
you damaged my laptop and you still want your noodles?

106
00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:05.259
no way!

107
00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:10.259
such a nice weather

108
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.379
xiaoling went to meet her boyfriend

109
00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:14.019
sisi went to alumni reunion

110
00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:16.500
yet I have to accompany you to have your laptop fixed

111
00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:18.500
this nice weather is all wasted...

112
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.759
how dare you?!

113
00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.759
who damaged my laptop? Let's go!

114
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.039
there are a few movies coming up soon

115
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120
let's send the laptop for repair

116
00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:45.159
and go for a movie

117
00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:47.259
I won't leave it in the store

118
00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:48.019
I will buy a mother board and replace it myself

119
00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:50.019
it is cheaper and faster that way

120
00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:51.519
and I have to use my laptop tonight

121
00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.159
no need to be so rushed...

122
00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.019
of course!

123
00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:56.460
a good CS student like me

124
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.320
will not live a day without a computer

125
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.700
human language please!

126
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.860
I have an appointment with somebody to PK tonight

127
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.120
I knew it!

128
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.440
how time flies! We are sophomore already

129
00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:22.159
it is hard to believe that in this university with tons of guys and a few girls

130
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.720
and in the CS department

131
00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.919
I haven't found anyone after two years!

132
00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.759
it is so pathetic

133
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.940
that's not the reason you picked this university, right?

134
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.100
there was more to it

135
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.700
Tsing University offers the No. 1 engineering course in China

136
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.879
it is my dream school

137
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.360
CS is my dream major

138
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.919
but all these

139
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.560
are just as important as my marriage!

140
00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:57.559
fast! let's go

141
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.820
what's going on?

142
00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:15.659
[ basketball tournament]

143
00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:24.299
[CS vs Biochem]

144
00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:27.419
Xiao Nai the legend is coming back for the basketball game!

145
00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:28.759
that's great!

146
00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:30.379
we can see the legend play again!

147
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.820
CS and biochem

148
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.320
Xiao Nai is the key player

149
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.520
we will for sure see him this time

150
00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:36.199
that's not certain

151
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.400
xiao nai is already a senior

152
00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.360
and he rarely comes to the campus now

153
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.860
it is said that the mystic post in BBS

154
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.100
hasn't been updated for a long time

155
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.740
I guess this time they are bluffing again

156
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.960
there is nothing to lose to just go there and take a look

157
00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:50.159
this might be the last chance to see him

158
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.440
that's true

159
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.400
it is heartbreaking

160
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:55.019
why doesn't he go to graduate school?

161
00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:56.399
what a pity!

162
00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:01.279
we have to go there one hour early to get a seat

163
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.480
weiwei

164
00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.779
I didn't know you were into Xiao Nai too

165
00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:08.339
of course, he is the legend

166
00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:10.919
I downloaded all the softwares he posted

167
00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:13.539
If our college is like a game

168
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.759
with rankings

169
00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:17.479
he will be the top for every skill

170
00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:22.419
girl, you are so sophisticated

171
00:12:22.419 --> 00:12:24.419
I only pay attention to the face and the body

172
00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:26.419
I can't understand you genius anyway

173
00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:32.480
who hacked the video of him swmming last time?

174
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.659
I really want to see it

175
00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:54.679
yiran

176
00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:56.299
let's get this one!

177
00:12:56.299 --> 00:12:57.679
nana

178
00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.059
we don't know this person

179
00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:01.419
how can I ask him to help?

180
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.460
relax

181
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.000
I know a person from his dorm

182
00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:07.299
so I came up with this idea

183
00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:09.259
we get the RAM first

184
00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:12.120
and then go to ask him to help

185
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.840
I doubt they will not help given it is you

186
00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.799
relax

187
00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:25.439
i already sent the goods over

188
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.679
ask him to check it

189
00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:31.039
how much is this?

190
00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:32.799
500

191
00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:34.879
that's so expensive

192
00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.759
you can go ask around, that's the price everywhere

193
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.639
this is really good stuff

194
00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:43.679
how about 450?

195
00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:45.919
no way, it is already the cheapest we can offer

196
00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:49.759
boss, this price

197
00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.039
is not that reasonable

198
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.720
the gold glare on this RAM doesn't look right

199
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.600
this is obviously second hand

200
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.879
you give a price for a brand new one

201
00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:01.759
this is unfair

202
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
rubbish, what do you know?

203
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.960
this is none of your buniness

204
00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:07.539
well, I am from CS, how much do you think I know?

205
00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:09.919
this store is just in front of my university

206
00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:11.839
yet you are selling at such an unfair price

207
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.600
i am afraid you won't get much business if the students know about it

208
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.960
that's true, this is too much

209
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.360
where is the previous owner?

210
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.440
where did he go?

211
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.600
which previous owner? I have always been the boss here

212
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
what's wrong with you two young girls

213
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.919
are you looking for trouble here?

214
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.600
you look so pretty, yet you have a filthy mouth. Shoo...

215
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.200
hey

216
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.480
this RAM usually goes for 200

217
00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:39.679
you can google for it if you don't believe me

218
00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.519
the online ones are all fake

219
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.639
of course they are cheap

220
00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:46.399
this girl looks like Bei Weiwei

221
00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:50.879
thank you so much

222
00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:52.799
I believe the boss will not lie to me

223
00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:55.679
and it is reasonable for him to earn some profit

224
00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:07.679
She pretended to be so nice and up-class

225
00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:09.599
for what? for who?

226
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.040
we were trying to help her

227
00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:12.000
now we looked like bad people

228
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.840
I know!

229
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.800
it must be because they recognized you

230
00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.240
and she's jealous of you

231
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600
you know her right? Meng Yiran

232
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.840
she was voted the most pretty girl on campus

233
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
oh, that's why she looks familiar

234
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.240
that must be the reason

235
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.960
last year the BBS's beauty

236
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.080
competition between you guys

237
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.360
was really heated

238
00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:38.879
of course she doesn't have good temper with you

239
00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:40.799
it wasn't heated last year

240
00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:42.799
and I won't forget who uploaded my picture online

241
00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:47.039
you already searched my PC and phone last year

242
00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:48.959
it wasn't me!

243
00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:53.600
Besides, I wouldn't upload such a blurry picture

244
00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:56.159
If it were me

245
00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:58.240
I would have posted an up-front, HD picture

246
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.240
from the bathroom

247
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.000
and about the picture of Meng Yiran

248
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.919
do you think it was PS?

249
00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:07.199
and it took a few days to PS

250
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.600
She doesn't look as good in real

251
00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:12.159
if she had posted a non-touched picture

252
00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:13.759
weiwei

253
00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:15.759
I can assure that you wouldn't have lost

254
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.840
I will go to the internet cafe later

255
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.720
and I remember she won last year

256
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.759
she's the champion, and I am the runner up.

257
00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.759
so I should be the one who is hostile

258
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.320
why is she hostile towards me?

259
00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:30.559
who knows?

260
00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:32.479
maybe

261
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
she is very flat...

262
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.919
go away!

263
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.480
she must be

264
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.399
and I finally know

265
00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:43.519
why you can't find a boyfriend

266
00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:45.120
why?

267
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.879
tell me! i will change at once

268
00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.799
because obviously you pay more attention to girls

269
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.200
weiwei, you think I don't dare to beat you up

270
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.440
ok ok, I will stop

271
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.040
take my laptop home for me

272
00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.519
you have no place to stand on

273
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.519
you spend all your time with computer

274
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.920
I heard from your dad

275
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.560
you want to start a company?

276
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.720
yes

277
00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:21.759
in which area?

278
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.480
I will start developing two games first

279
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.599
if you win this round

280
00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.039
I will give you a gift

281
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.240
weiwei

282
00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:55.980
luwei weiwei

283
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.019
I thought you chickened out

284
00:17:57.519 --> 00:17:59.519
I don't think i am late

285
00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.759
whether you are late or not, the outcome will still be the same

286
00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:03.359
get your necklace ready

287
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:06.559
let's start

288
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.559
it's your turn

289
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.640
thanks

290
00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:21.279
thanks

291
00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:25.359
no wonder luwei weiwei is the only top female player on the PK list

292
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.680
this is one way massacre

293
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.020
how does she operate her flying skill so well?

294
00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:34.419
that dodge was amazing

295
00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:36.799
yet she is only No. 6 on the PK list?

296
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.720
who is No. 1?

297
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.480
Is No.1 the legendary Yixiao naihe?

298
00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.559
I don't know if I have met him before

299
00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:43.679
this ID is so pretencious

300
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.480
luwei weiwei, let's PK again!

301
00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:53.119
okay, but I am in an internet cafe

302
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.160
I only paid for an hour

303
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.759
let's do a quick one

304
00:19:59.759 --> 00:20:01.759
according to our agreement

305
00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:03.039
you won this game

306
00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.159
uncle will give you a gift

307
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
this place shall be my gift

308
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.400
don't you want to run a game company?

309
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.539
this place is good for a start up after renovating

310
00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:17.119
uncle

311
00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:19.039
this is your plan

312
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.319
I didn't agree

313
00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:21.919
you don't want my gift?

314
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.460
no

315
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.700
little bastard

316
00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:27.819
that's the spirit

317
00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:32.339
i just feel that there's more sense of satisfaction starting from scratch

318
00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:36.240
besides, I have already found a place

319
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160
we are both mutants in the family

320
00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:48.779
who like computers

321
00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:50.720
your dad is an archeologist

322
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.500
your mom is a historian

323
00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:55.019
how come you are doing CS

324
00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:57.359
I can tell that you are my type

325
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.500
I don't have lots of time for this internet cafe

326
00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.180
If you don't want this place

327
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:04.900
I will close it first

328
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.360
boss, there's a call for you

329
00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:07.399
okay

330
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.240
what are you doing?

331
00:22:22.619 --> 00:22:25.500
it is almost time to go to your place

332
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.240
I will make a couple of dishes

333
00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.819
xiaoling!

334
00:22:57.019 --> 00:22:59.400
stop, what happened?

335
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.740
I don't know how to solve this problem

336
00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:04.519
erxi, can you take my bed sheet back for me?

337
00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:06.279
i am busy

338
00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:10.059
this one and this one

339
00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:13.599
hurry up, it is raining

340
00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:26.039
erxi, can you please bring my bed sheet back

341
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.200
you have the time to bug me, why not go get it yourself

342
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.860
I have my facial mask on

343
00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:31.199
sisi, sisi

344
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.460
somebody is at the door

345
00:23:34.359 --> 00:23:36.359
thank you! weiwei

346
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.720
it is pouring outside

347
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.720
why didn't you take your bed sheet back

348
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.200
weiwei

349
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.200
why are you so late?

350
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.779
why do you ask

351
00:23:54.779 --> 00:23:56.779
the heroin must have been fighting in the game

352
00:23:56.779 --> 00:23:58.180
she even left her laptop with me

353
00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:00.519
I put your laptop back

354
00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:03.839
thank you very much, erxi

355
00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:06.039
oh, today the heroin and I

356
00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:08.039
were trying to do good

357
00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:09.379
and only got ourselves upset

358
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.800
what happened?

359
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.799
it was that Meng yiran

360
00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:14.799
Meng Yiran?

361
00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:15.559
weiwei

362
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.440
when did you get to know Meng Yiran?

363
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.799
how come you didn't mention about it?

364
00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.680
I don't know her

365
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.759
I went to the computer store with erxi

366
00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:23.339
and ran into her

367
00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:25.819
the owner was trying to trick her into buying a second hand RAM

368
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.160
I am a CS major

369
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.880
I couldn't just sit and  watch

370
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.880
obviously you helped her

371
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.620
but what did she say?

372
00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:36.319
'Thank you, this lady

373
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.460
But i believe the boss will not lie to me

374
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.220
besides it is fair that he's earning some profit, he is doing a business after all'

375
00:24:45.019 --> 00:24:47.019
what? now she is the nice one, and we are just caring about price

376
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.980
and petty

377
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.980
in the end the boss wouldn't even sell anything to us

378
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.120
weiwei, what will you do to your laptop then?

379
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.400
It is expensive to change motherboard anyway

380
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.940
I have a plan

381
00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.940
I will buy a capacitance online

382
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.940
and replace it myself

383
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.380
capacitance?

384
00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:07.039
although I am also a CS major

385
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.920
I always feel that

386
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.580
we are not in the same college

387
00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:16.519
I don't understand at all

388
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.440
same

389
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.840
I am so lonely

390
00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:29.079
where is the stuff I left here this morning?

391
00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:32.559
are you looking for the notebook for the game?

392
00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:34.359
do you know where it is?

393
00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:35.619
here!

394
00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:37.159
thank you my dear

395
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.660
you record

396
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.660
this everyday

397
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.660
and I have no idea what you are writing about

398
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.920
other than study, gaming, and taking notes

399
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.880
you should also do something else

400
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.460
no need, I like it this way

401
00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:51.019
don't underestimate this

402
00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:51.519
maybe I will become a game designer in the future

403
00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:54.359
and I will rely on this

404
00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:55.759
I may be lucky to join FengTeng

405
00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:57.700
and take part in the game design of  the new "pretty ghost story"

406
00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:00.319
erxi

407
00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:02.599
I don't understand you

408
00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:04.079
other people play games to kill time

409
00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:05.919
you play game to plan your career

410
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.240
the brain of a good student

411
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.160
is certainly different from ours

412
00:26:25.259 --> 00:26:27.259
Yiran, I have to write a report

413
00:26:27.259 --> 00:26:29.140
can you wait for me here

414
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.220
I will be ready soon

415
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.940
so the girl yesterday was Bei Weiwei

416
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.220
yes, the runner up in the college beauty contest

417
00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:47.039
the one who lost to you

418
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.160
she is pretty

419
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.980
she is not as good as you

420
00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.400
she looks really gaudy

421
00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:55.019
and looks like a pretty vase

422
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.840
if she acts in a TV drama

423
00:26:58.119 --> 00:26:59.859
she must be one of the supporting actresses

424
00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:00.959
she can't compare to you

425
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.259
nana, don't bad mouth people like that

426
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.160
fine fine fine, can't I tell the truth?

427
00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.940
she is dfferent from what I expected

428
00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:11.119
she is quite warm-hearted

429
00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:13.579
yiran

430
00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:15.579
don't get tricked by words

431
00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:16.960
she was just showing off her knowledge

432
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.420
and making us look stupid

433
00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:22.359
really?

434
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.740
Yiran

435
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.400
just because you fall in love with a CS student

436
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.660
don't fall in love with all CS students

437
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.040
and assume that all CS students are nice

438
00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:32.480
hey, don't utter nonsense

439
00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:33.779
it is true

440
00:27:34.259 --> 00:27:36.259
a few days ago Cao Guang took a photo of her

441
00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:38.000
getting out of a luxury car

442
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.059
that car costs at least a few million

443
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.380
Bei Weiwei is not as simple as you thought

444
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.220
really?

445
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.579
of course

446
00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:48.079
Speaking of which...

447
00:27:49.819 --> 00:27:51.819
cao guang

448
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.960
can you show Yiran and me

449
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.600
the photo you took of Bei Weiwei

450
00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:55.959
a few days ago?

451
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.900
how did you know?

452
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.120
I was behind you

453
00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.960
but you were really fast

454
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.200
it didn't occur to me that I should take a photo

455
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.000
I deleted it

456
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.799
deleted?

457
00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.579
are you into her?

458
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.740
you want to cover up for her?

459
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.440
what a joke!

460
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.740
why would I be interested in that kind of girl?

461
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.680
see, did you hear that

462
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.240
the look matches the soul

463
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.220
so don't be fooled

464
00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:52.339
weiwei

465
00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:53.819
zhenyi tech is recruiting summer interns

466
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.259
they want a few CS majors

467
00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:56.680
Shall I apply for you all?

468
00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.140
okay, sounds good

469
00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:00.319
we have to find summer intern anyway

470
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.560
apply for Xiaoling and sisi too

471
00:29:04.819 --> 00:29:05.619
okay

472
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.380
done

473
00:29:21.579 --> 00:29:23.579
you really fixed it

474
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.980
if I have hardware issue in the future

475
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.620
I will depend on you

476
00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:29.199
no problem

477
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.519
five cents of technology aid

478
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:31.279
is at your service

479
00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:33.019
got on to the game immediately

480
00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:35.240
you are addicted!

481
00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:39.440
I have done all my revision

482
00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:40.819
and my housework

483
00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:42.399
this only means

484
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.240
I am very efficient

485
00:29:46.579 --> 00:29:47.599
I am just kidding

486
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.180
you are so full of yourself

487
00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:53.779
actually, I thought gaming was a waste of time before

488
00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.180
but after I started playing it

489
00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.940
I found that it is a whole new world

490
00:29:58.299 --> 00:30:00.299
there is dream

491
00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:02.299
and there is talent

492
00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:04.599
why can't I work harder?

493
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.160
weiwei

494
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.160
come to three life stone

495
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.160
let's divorce

496
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.320
why?

497
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.299
sorry. don't ask why

498
00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:55.159
I will compensate you with a set of armor

499
00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:57.839
oh there is even palimony

500
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
no need, I will be there soon

501
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.660
see you soon

502
00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:23.519
you are here

503
00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:25.400
I am really sorry

504
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.640
that's okay

505
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.860
let's go

506
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.420
Today the moon is still the same

507
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.400
however the love and hate changed

508
00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:45.599
sea becomes field,

509
00:31:45.599 --> 00:31:47.599
weather changes

510
00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:48.619
love is hard to find

511
00:31:48.819 --> 00:31:50.819
[ are you sure you want to break up?][yes][no]

512
00:31:50.819 --> 00:31:52.519
[yes]

513
00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:10.799
drink the water, forget the love

514
00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:12.019
couple will become stangers

515
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200
the relationship between Luwei weiwei and Zhenshui Wuxiang

516
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.200
has broken

517
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.180
and they will go on separate ways

518
00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:27.259
I still have a quest

519
00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:29.259
I have to leave now

520
00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:30.299
hold on

521
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.180
take this set of armor

522
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.440
you should take it

523
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.539
as my compensation

524
00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:39.660
it's really not necessary

525
00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.720
we got married

526
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.720
for the sake of completing the quest

527
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.559
don't feel bad for the divorce

528
00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:48.319
I am going to my daily quest

529
00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:51.759
let's fight the boss together in the future if there's a chance

530
00:32:52.059 --> 00:32:52.819
ok

531
00:32:57.839 --> 00:32:59.839
weiwei

532
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.800
you are still collecting herbs?

533
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.640
what happened

534
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.160
are you asking me what happened?

535
00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:07.180
you got divorced?

536
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.220
yes

537
00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.100
I thought something important happened.

538
00:33:11.099 --> 00:33:12.699
why are you so calm?

539
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.539
I heard that he will marry xiaoyu yaoyao soon

540
00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:17.059
xiaoyu yaoyao?

541
00:33:17.059 --> 00:33:18.779
you didn't know?

542
00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:20.500
She was the first in the "dream angel" contest

543
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.140
so called "pretty ghost No.1"

544
00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:25.599
go take a look on the official webpage

545
00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:27.599
don't collect herb anymore

546
00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:28.899
I will take a look now

547
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.400
have you really divorced?

548
00:33:45.819 --> 00:33:49.339
yes, anyway we had gotten married for the sake of quests

549
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.640
don't think too much

550
00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:53.259
I still feel it is quite disappointing

551
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.420
I feel Zhenshui is a good person

552
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.300
I didn't expect to see this happen

553
00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.480
but that xiaoyu yaoyao

554
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.660
is really pretty

555
00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:03.799
I heard the original target of Xiaoyu yaoyao

556
00:34:03.799 --> 00:34:06.119
was that guy in the armor ranking list

557
00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:07.440
I didn't expect her to end up with Zhenshui

558
00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:09.579
but a few days ago

559
00:34:09.579 --> 00:34:10.799
I saw them leveling up together

560
00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:14.539
I see

561
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.940
well, it is not entirely his fault

562
00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.099
weiwei

563
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.699
actually...

564
00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:25.219
what?

565
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.840
your operation is so good

566
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.140
you're ranked no.6 in the list

567
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.700
and you have never asked guys for armor

568
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.740
and never posted any photo

569
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.480
actually everyone thought you were a "lady boy"

570
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.400
lady boy?!

571
00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.260
what?

572
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.640
not showing photo doesn't mean i am a lady boy

573
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.700
I hate this world where only the look matters

574
00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.159
weiwei

575
00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.899
you are the prettiest girl in CS

576
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.860
if you say this

577
00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.360
how can we still live?

578
00:34:58.099 --> 00:34:59.819
I was reading the crucial moment

579
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.360
and imaging myself as the leading girl

580
00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.360
and you dragged me back to reality

581
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.900
congratulations to Zhenshui Wuxiang

582
00:35:07.019 --> 00:35:09.019
and Xiaoyu Yaoyao

583
00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:10.820
who are happily married today

584
00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:39.039
he is so capable

585
00:35:39.039 --> 00:35:39.880
true

586
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.500
I really have a good feeling about this couple

587
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.699
yes

588
00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:46.519
they are a lovely couple

589
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:47.699
marriage made in heaven

590
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.960
make a guess

591
00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:16.639
how much will Zhenshui

592
00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:18.219
give as wedding gift this time?

593
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.860
I only need 888

594
00:36:21.219 --> 00:36:23.419
I can't help but think of Luwei Weiwei

595
00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.220
I wonder how she is feeling like right now

596
00:36:25.219 --> 00:36:25.719


597
00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:28.679
luwei weiwei

598
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.860
did you see?

599
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.760
I saw the ex-wife of Zhenshui

600
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.740
standing on the bridge of red sparrow

601
00:36:35.739 --> 00:36:37.279
yes i saw her too

602
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.900
she looked sad

603
00:36:41.179 --> 00:36:43.839
people only see the smiles on the new couple

604
00:36:44.099 --> 00:36:46.860
who will listen to the cry of the abandoned?

605
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.340
wow, it's exciting today

606
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.039
she may be here to take the groom

607
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.260
weiwei

608
00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.560
be quick, I want to go to bathroom too

609
00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:19.639
wait

610
00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:21.379
I support weiwei for snatching Zhenshui

611
00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.400
Xiaoyu yaoyao is mine

612
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.500
okay, in a minute

613
00:37:33.659 --> 00:37:35.659
you can be a fair lady

614
00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:37.659
there is no need for this

615
00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:42.079
xiaoyu yaoyao is shameless!

616
00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:43.880
xiaoyu yaoyao is shameless

617
00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.340
xiaoyu yaoyao is shameless

618
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.720
[xiao yu yao yao is shameless 108] player is banned for 24 hours for use of  improper language

619
00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.340
what's wrong with that luwei weiwei

620
00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.720
she was abandoned

621
00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:00.719
yet she has the cheek to show up

622
00:38:00.719 --> 00:38:01.699
zhenshui

623
00:38:01.699 --> 00:38:03.599
What did you do?

624
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:05.599
that lady boy must be jealous of yaoyao

625
00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:06.659
and is here to bully her

626
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:08.539
you have to settle this

627
00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:09.960
yes, you have to settle this

628
00:38:10.159 --> 00:38:12.159
don't blame zhenshui

629
00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:13.299
he didn't want this to happen

630
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.760
I trust him

631
00:38:17.619 --> 00:38:19.619
yaoyao

632
00:38:19.619 --> 00:38:20.500
I will settle this properly

633
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.860
weiwei, hurry up!

634
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.340
I just went to the bathroom

635
00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:56.199
what did I do?

636
00:38:56.199 --> 00:38:58.199
now everyone thought I am here to kidnap the groom

637
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.480
now if I run away

638
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.880
people will definitely think that I am heart broken

639
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.300
what's the matter?

640
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.980
didn't you agree yesterday?

641
00:39:23.159 --> 00:39:25.019
besides, I offered to compensate

642
00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:27.019
you didn't want it
